 * @brief  Header for HyperLogLog counters.
 *
 * This header defines data structures and operations related to
 * HyperLogLog counters
 * [[FlFuGaMe07](http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf)].
 *
 * Introduction
 * ------------
 *
 * This counters are probabilistic data structures used to keep track
 * of the cardinality of large multisets.
 *
 * Operations allowed on the counter
 * ---------------------------------
 *
 * On a counter we can perform the following operations
 *
 *  - add a new element: hll_cnt_add(hll_hash_t, hll_counter_t)
 *  - query for the estimated size of the underlying multiset:
 *    hll_cnt_size(hll_counter_t)
 *  - get the union of two counters: hll_cnt_union(hll_counter_t, hll_counter_t)
 *
 * Algorithm
 * ---------
 *
 * The HyperLogLog enables to keep track of the cardinalities of very large
 * multisets in very little space.
 *
 * In fact this algorithm only needs \f$O(\log\log n)\f$
 * memory (hence the name) to keep track of cardinalities up to \f$n\f$.
 *
 * In the description that follows we assume that we have an hash function
 * \f$h(x)\f$ that maps the set elements into binary strings.
 * The function \f$\rho(y)\f$ is used to get the position of the leftmost 1-bit
 * in the binary string \f$y\f$.
 * 
 * This algorithm, uses stochastic averaging to control
 * the standard error on the estimated value. The input multiset
 * \f$\mathcal{M}\f$ is partitioned in \f$m = 2^b\f$ multisets
 * \f$\mathcal{M}_1 \dots \mathcal{M}_m\f$ using the first \f$b\f$ bits of the
 * hashed values.
 * 
 * Then for each \f$\mathcal{M}_j\f$ the
 * observable is
 * \f[
 *   M^j = \max_{x \in \mathcal{M}_j} \rho(x)
 * \f]
 * 
 * The intuition underlying the algorithm is the following: each multiset
 * \f$\mathcal{M}_j\f$ is expected to contain \f$n/m\f$ distinct elements at
 * the end of the execution. Hence the parameter \f$M^j\f$ should be close to
 * \f$\log_2(n/m)\f$. The harmonic mean of the quantities \f$2^{M^j}\f$ should
 * then be in the order of \f$n/m\f$.
 * 
 * The algorithm returns the following estimate of the cardinality
 * \f[
 *  N = \frac{\alpha m^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{m} 2^{-M^j}}
 * \f]
 * 
 * The parameter \f$\alpha\f$ is used to correct a multiplicative bias of the
 * algorithm and is defined in macro ::HLL_ALPHA.
 *
 * Compilation notes
 * =================
 *
 * When compiling, the dimension of the has values is conditionally determined
 * based on a couple of macros:
 *
 *  - `HASH_SMALL`: uses 8 bit hashes, that is `uint8_t`
 *  - `HASH_MEDIUM`: use `uint16_t` integers for hash values
 *  - `HASH_BIG`: use `uint32_t` integers, this is the default
 *  - `HASH_HUGE`: use 64 bit hashes, that is `uint64_t` integers
 *
 * The rationale behind using different integer types is that graphs that have
 * a number of nodes significantly smaller than the maximum representable by
 * the datatype will underutilize the registers. The problem with this is that
 * in this way we get only the first couple of registers with nonzero values,
 * heavily biasing the cardinality extimation.
 *
 * To select the right flag at compilation time, specify it on the command line
 * of `cmake`:
 *
 *     mkdir gdem_small
 *     cd gdem_small
 *     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DHASH_SIZE=Small ..
 *     make
 *
 * Thus we will get different binaries, each suitable for different graph sizes.

Graph Diameter Estimator on MPI

How to build
------------

From the root directory of the project

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

How to run tests
----------------

In the build directory

    make
    make test

How to generate documentation
-----------------------------

In the build directory

    make doc

The generated documentation will be available in `doc/html`

The documentation of the script `scripts/pair2adjacency.py` is available 
[here](http://www.dei.unipd.it/~ceccarel/gdem-docs/pair2adjacency.html).

Use of `scan-build` to detect potential bugs
--------------------------------------------

The `clang` static analizer can be used to detect potential bugs
in the code. First install the latest version of the `clang` compiler.
Then, from the project root directory

    mkdir check
    cd check
    scan-build cmake ..
    scan-build make

The static analyzer will output something similar to this

    scan-build: Using '/usr/bin/clang' for static analysis

    scan-build: Run 'scan-view /tmp/scan-build-2013-05-22-1' to examine bug reports.

To view the report generated by the tool, run the command suggested in the output, 
in this case

    scan-view /tmp/scan-build-2013-05-22-1

How to configure Eclipse
------------------------

To generate project files for the Eclipse IDE, run the following from 
the project root directory

    cd ..
    mkdir gdem_eclipse
    cd gdem_eclipse
    cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" ../gdem

Then you can import the project into Eclipse from the directory
`gdem_eclipse`. Please note that due to the way Eclipse works (at least
Eclipse Indigo) the Eclipse directory _must_ be a sibiling of the project's
root directory in order to perform out of source builds (that is highly desirable).

We will like to announce the availability of the Big Data Message Passing 
Interface (BDMPI). BDMPI is a message passing library and associated 
runtime system for developing high-performance out-of-core distributed 
computing applications. BDMPI is designed for problems whose aggregate 
memory requirements exceed the amount of memory that is available on 
the underlying computing cluster. 

BDMPI is based on the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and allows existing 
MPI-based applications to compile unchanged and efficiently run in an 
out-of-core fashion. In addition, BDMPI provides a small number of new
APIs that are tuned for its memory and execution model, which lead to 
further performance improvements.

Information about BDMPI and instructions on how to download it and use 
it is available at:
